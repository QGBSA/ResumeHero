Here’s a structured list that can serve as a guideline for creating an ATS-optimized resume.

### **ATS-Optimized Resume Guidelines**

**1. Formatting**
- **Simple Layout**: Stick to a clean, minimalistic design. Avoid tables, images, graphics, or complex bullet styles. Stick with basic symbols like dots or dashes.
- **File Type**: Use `.docx` or `.pdf` formats to ensure compatibility with ATS parsing software.
- **Standard Fonts**: Use fonts like Arial, Times New Roman, or Calibri. Avoid decorative or script fonts, as they can disrupt ATS readability.
- **No Headers/Footers**: Place all information in the main body of the document since ATS systems may skip headers or footers.


**2. Resume Format Options**
- **Chronological**: Most ATS-friendly format; lists experience in reverse chronological order.
- **Functional**: Focuses on skills rather than job history, though it may not be ideal for all ATS.
- **Combination**: Blends chronological and skills-based approaches, showcasing both relevant skills and career progression.



**3. Section Headings**
- **Standard Labels**: Use conventional section titles such as “Work Experience,” “Education,” and “Skills” to prevent parsing errors. Avoid creative titles like "My Journey" or "Skills Toolbox."


**4. Content & Keywords**
- **Targeted Keywords**: Incorporate keywords from the job description in a natural way. Use variations of keywords (e.g., “project management” and “PM”) to improve compatibility.
- **Matching Job Titles**: Align job titles with those in the job posting when feasible, as long as it accurately reflects your role.
- **Quantifiable Results**: Use specific metrics to highlight achievements, such as “Increased revenue by 25%” or “Reduced costs by $50,000.”


**5. Job-Specific Adjustments**
- **Education and Certification**: Match degree or certification titles to those in the job description. For instance, if the job requires “B.Sc. in Marketing,” use this phrasing if it applies to your background.
- **Date Formatting**: Use a consistent format, such as MM/YY or Month YYYY (e.g., 04/2022 or April 2022) to prevent any parsing issues.



**6. Contact Information**
- **Complete and Accurate Details**: Ensure the email and phone number are correct and visible, as well as your LinkedIn profile or relevant online portfolio, if applicable.


**7. Length & Readability**
- **Concise Content**: Keep your resume to one page if you have fewer than ten years of experience; use two pages for more extensive careers.
- **Brief Paragraphs and Bullet Points**: Use bullet points and short paragraphs to improve readability and allow ATS systems to scan each section effectively.


**8. Action-Oriented Language**
- **Use Active Verbs**: Use direct action verbs like “developed,” “led,” or “managed” to demonstrate skills and accomplishments without relying on industry buzzwords.
- **Avoid Negative or Vague Language**: Avoid phrases like “was responsible for” and instead state actions taken, e.g., “Managed a team of…”


**9. Web Presence**
- **Professional Links**: Include links to professional profiles or portfolios (such as LinkedIn or GitHub) if they add value to the role.


**10. Font and Layout Consistency**
- **Uniform Font Choices**: Use bold or italics for emphasis where needed, but ensure consistency.
- **Page Layout**: Use standard letter size with margins between 0.5 and 1 inch, and align text to the left for maximum readability.


**11. Summary Section**
- **Concise Professional Summary**: Include a brief summary at the top of your resume to highlight your qualifications and grab recruiters’ attention quickly. 


By following these rules, you can create a resume that not only looks polished but also performs well in ATS systems, increasing the likelihood of passing the initial screening phase.
